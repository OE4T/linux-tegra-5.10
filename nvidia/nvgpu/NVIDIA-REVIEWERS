This is a reviewers file that can be parsed by get_nv_reviewers.py that
internally uses scripts/get_maintainer.pl from kernel.

See the MAINTAINERS file in the Linux kernel source tree for details of the
file format. The file format is defined by the upstream Linux kernel community,
so don't modify it without upstreaming any changes to get_maintainer.pl.

Descriptions of section entries (copied from MAINTAINERS):

	P: Person (obsolete)
	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	B: NvBugs Module Name
	W: Web-page with status/info
	Q: Patchwork web based patch tracking system site
	T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit, topgit.
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
	   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   patch or file.  For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.

Note: For the hard of thinking, this list is meant to remain in alphabetical
order. If you could add yourselves to it in alphabetical order that would be
so much easier [Ed]
