 * address space to define the addresses it has access to.
 *
 * Once a nvgpu channel has been bound to an address space it cannot be
 * unbound. There is no support for allowing an nvgpu channel to change from
 * one address space to another (or from one to none).
 *
 * As long as there is an open device file to the address space, or any bound
 * nvgpu channels it will be valid.  Once all references to the address space

/*
 * VM map buffer IOCTL
 *
 * This ioctl maps a buffer - generally a dma_buf FD - into the VM's address
 * space. Usage of this API is as follows.
 *
 * @flags  [IN]
 *
 *   These are the flags passed to the IOCTL to modify the IOCTL behavior. The
 *   following flags are supported:
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_FIXED_OFFSET
 *
 *     Specify that the mapping already has an address. The mapping address
 *     must reside in an area already reserved with the as_alloc_space IOCTL.
 *     If this flag is set then the @offset field must be populated with the
 *     address to map to.
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_CACHEABLE
 *
 *     Specify that a mapping shall be GPU cachable.
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_IO_COHERENT
 *
 *     Specify that a mapping shall be IO coherent.
 *
 *     DEPRECATED: do not use! This will be removed in a future update.
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_UNMAPPED_PTE
 *
 *     Specify that a mapping shall be marked as invalid but otherwise
 *     populated. This flag doesn't actually make a lot of sense. The
 *     only reason to specify it is for testing replayable faults but
 *     an actual useful implementation of such a feature would likely
 *     not use this.
 *
 *     DEPRECATED: do not use! This will be removed in a future update.
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_MAPPABLE_COMPBITS
 *
 *     Deprecated.
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_DIRECT_KIND_CTRL
 *
 *     Set when userspace plans to pass in @compr_kind and @incompr_kind
 *     instead of letting the kernel work out kind fields.
 *
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_PLATFORM_ATOMIC
 *
 *     Specify that a mapping should use platform atomics.
 *
 * @kind  [IN]
 *
 *   Specify the kind to use for the mapping.
 *
 * @compr_kind  [IN]
 * @incompr_kind  [IN]
 *
 *   Specify the compressible and incompressible kinds to be used for the
 *   mapping. Requires that %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_DIRECT_KIND_CTRL is
 *   set in @flags. The kernel will attempt to use @comp_kind and if for
 *   some reason that is not possible will then fall back to using the
 *   @incompr_kind.
 *
 * @dmabuf_fd  [IN]
 *
 *   FD pointing to the dmabuf that will be mapped into the GMMU.
 *
 * @page_size  [IN]
 *
 *   Specify the page size for the mapping. Must be set to a valid, supported
 *   page size. If left unset this IOCTL will return -EINVAL. In general, a
 *   small page size mapping will always be supported, but in certain cases of
 *   compression this will not be the case.
 *
 * @buffer_offset  [IN]
 *
 *   Specify an offset into the physical buffer to begin the mapping at. For
 *   example imagine a DMA buffer 32KB long. However, you wish to only map
 *   this buffer starting at 8KB. In such a case you would pass 8KB as the
 *   @buffer_offset. This is only available with fixed address mappings. All
 *   regular (non-fixed) mappings require this field to be set to 0. This field
 *   is in bytes.
 *
 * @mapping_size  [IN]
 *
 *   The size of the mapping in bytes. This is from the @buffer_offset position.
 *   So for example, assuming you have a 32KB physical buffer and you want to
 *   map only 8KB of it, starting at some offset, then you would specify 8192 in
 *   this field. Of course this size + the buffer_offset must be less than the
 *   length of the physical buffer; otherwise -EINVAL is returned. This is only
 *   supported for fixed mappings.
 *
 * @offset  [IN, OUT]
 *
 *   The offset of the buffer in the GPU virtual address space. In other words
 *   the virtual address of the buffer. If the
 *   %NVGPU_AS_MAP_BUFFER_FLAGS_FIXED_OFFSET flag is set then this field must be
 *   populated by userspace. In all cases the ultimate mapped address is
 *   returned in this field. The field is in bytes.

 *       Specify that the associated mapping shall be GPU cachable.
 *
 *     %NVGPU_AS_REMAP_OP_FLAGS_ACCESS_NO_WRITE

 *
 * @compr_kind  [IN/OUT]
 * @incompr_kind  [IN/OUT]
 *
 *   On input these fields specify the compressible and incompressible kinds

 *   memory buffer to be mapped.  This field must be zero for unmap
 *   operations.
