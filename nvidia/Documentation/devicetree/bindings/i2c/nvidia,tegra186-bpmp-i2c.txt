NVIDIA Tegra186/Tegra194 BPMP I2C controller

In Tegra186/Tegra194, the BPMP (Boot and Power Management Processor) owns
certain HW devices, such as the I2C controller for the power management I2C
bus. Software running on other CPUs must perform IPC to the BPMP in order
to execute transactions on that I2C bus. This binding describes an I2C bus
that is accessed in such a fashion.

This node represents an I2C controller. See ../i2c/i2c.txt for details of the
core I2C binding.

Required properties:
- compatible:
    Array of strings.
    One of:
    - "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-i2c".
- #address-cells: Address cells for I2C device address.
    Single-cell integer.
    Must be <1>.
- #size-cells:
    Single-cell integer.
    Must be <0>.
- adapter:
    Single-cell integer.
    Indicates the I2C bus number this DT node represent, as defined by the
    BPMP firmware.

Example:

bpmp_i2c {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-i2c";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	adapter = <5>;
};
