The NvSciIpc(Nvidia Software Communication Interfaces - Inter Process Communication) library
provides API for any two entities in a system to communicate with each other irrespective of

NvSciIpc Kernel driver implements the Kernel space support needed for NvSciIpc functionality.
At present this is used only to support secure buffer sharing usecase across processes

Required properties:
