NVIDIA MODS driver stub for retrieving physical addresses.

NVIDIA MODS driver is a driver used by diagnostic software.  One of the
functions provided by the driver is retrieving physical addresses associated
with page-locked memory used in user space for communication with devices.
In order to be able to retrieve physical addresses, the NVIDIA MODS driver
registers itself as a dummy platform driver, which requires specifying a
device tree node.  This device tree node is defined inside in the driver just
for the registration and it does not have to exist in the device tree at all.
