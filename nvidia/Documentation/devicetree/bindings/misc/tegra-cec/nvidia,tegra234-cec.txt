NVIDIA Tegra Consumer Electronics Control

The Tegra Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) provides an engine for programming
CEC protocol so that CEC data can be transmitted and received to connected HDMI monitor.

This document describes the device tree bindings for the CEC hardware.

Required properties:
- status: Should be "disabled" in SoC and "okay" in Board DTSI.
- compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra234-cec".
- reg: A list of physical base address and length of CEC's registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt IRQ info for the CEC hardware.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  "TEGRA234_RESET_CEC"
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.

In order to enable CEC on a specific board, Board DTSI should be used.
The Pinmux settings should be also changed in Board Pinmux DTSI file as given
below. Only change pinmux settings if CEC functionality is needed. Otherwise
it will draw more power as PAD is always powered on due to below settings.

Example:
=======

SoC DTSI:
--------

tegra_cec: tegra_cec {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra234-cec";
	reg = <0x0 0x0c3e0000 0x0 0x00001000>;
	interrupts = <0 279 0x04>;
	resets = <&bpmp_resets TEGRA234_RESET_CEC>;
	reset-names = "cec";
	status = "disabled";
};

Board DTSI:
----------

tegra_cec: tegra_cec {
	status = "okay";
};

Pinmux DTSI:
-----------

Required properties:
- nvidia,pins : String contains the name of a pin on which CEC is connected.
    This must be set as per board schematic.
- nvidia,function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
    pin. Must be set to "hdmi".
- nvidia,pull: Integer, representing the pull-down/up to apply to the pin.
    0: none, 1: down, 2: up. Must be set to "TEGRA_PIN_PULL_UP"
- nvidia,tristate: Integer.
    0: passthrough, 1: tristate. Must be set to TEGRA_PIN_PASSTHROUGH/DISABLE
- nvidia,enable-input: Integer. Enable the pin's input path.
    enable :TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE0 and
    disable or output only: TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE. Must be set to ""
- nvidia,io-high-voltage: input/output voltage.
    enable: TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE.
    disable: TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE. Must be set to "TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE". This will
    drain more power as PAD is set to high voltage on always.
- nvidia,io-high-voltage: LPDR settings
    enable: TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE.
    disable: TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE. Must be set to "TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE".

Example:
=======

hdmi_cec_pgg0 {
	nvidia,pins = "hdmi_cec_pgg0";
	nvidia,function = "hdmi";
	nvidia,pull = <TEGRA_PIN_PULL_UP>;
	nvidia,tristate = <TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE>;
	nvidia,enable-input = <TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE>;
	nvidia,io-high-voltage = <TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE>;
	nvidia,lpdr = <TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE>;
};
