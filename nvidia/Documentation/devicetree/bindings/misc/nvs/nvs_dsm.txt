* NVidia Sensor (NVS) Dynamic Sensor Meta (DSM)

This driver uses the NVidia Sensor (NVS) framework.
See the nvs.txt documentation for NVS DT capabilities.
The nvs_dsm sensor driver supports dynamic sensors.

Required properties:
- compatible: Device or generic name.
	      Supported device names:
	      - nvidia,nvs_dsm

Optional properties:
- status: set to "ok" or "okay" for normal operation.  Set to anything else
	  to unload the driver without ever communicating with the device.
  Note: The "anything else" above is typically "disabled".
	Since the driver will unload without communicating with the device, the
	device will be left in its POR state.

Example:
	nvs_dsm {
		compatible = "nvidia,nvs_dsm";
		status = "okay";
	};
