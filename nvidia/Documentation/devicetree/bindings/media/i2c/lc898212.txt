ON Semiconductor LC898212 Camera Focuser, NVIDIA TCF driver bindings

The ON Semiconductor LC898212 is a digitally-controlled voice coil motor (VCM)
focuser module built into embedded camera packages.

Camera-board specific overlays are applied by the NVIDIA Tegra plugin-manager
pre-boot, they define the physical regulator and GPIO connections which differ
by the Jetson board and chip generation, and the camera daughter board revision.

Required properties:
	- compatible: Should be "onnn,lc898212".
	- reg: Sensor I2C bus address, default is 0x72.

	- vcmvdd-reg: Name of the voice coil motor (VCM) focuser power
		regulator.
	- vvcm-supply: Voice coil motor (VCM) focuser power source.

	- min_focus_distance: Minimum focus distance ratio.
	- hyper_focal: Hyperfocal distance ratio.
	- focal_length: Focal length.
	- f_number: Focuser f-number.
	- aperture: Focuser aperture f-number.

Optional properties:
	- support_mfi: Whether focuser synchronization is supported.

Deprecated properties:
	- devnode: Name of V4L2 character device in filesystem, this property is
		now deprecated, the Tegra Camera Framework enumerates them
		automatically.
	- type: Set to "default" if property is still necessary in software
		stack.

Example:

	lc898212@72 {
		compatible = "onnn,lc898212";
		reg = <0x72>;

		/* physical camera layer interface tags */
		devnode = "video3";
		type = "default";
		min_focus_distance = "10.0"; /* 1.0f/0.1f */
		hyper_focal = "0.2"; /* 1.0f/5.0f */
		focal_length = "4.73";
		f_number = "2.2";
		aperture = "2.2";
	};

	/* Camera board-specific config overlay */
	lc898212_2: lc898212@72 {
		vvcm-supply = <&en_vdd_vcm_2v8>;
		support_mfi = "true";
	};
