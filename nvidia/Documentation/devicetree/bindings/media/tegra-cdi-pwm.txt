NVIDIA tegra cdi pwm driver

This file documents the properties used by the cdi-mgr driver in tegra platform

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "nvidia,cdi-pwm"
- pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM chip, chip-relative PWM number and to
         specify the period time to be used
- pwm-cells : Specify the number of cells used for the PWM chip
- npwm : number of PWMs controlled by this chip
- force_on : Force to turn PWM on and disable control of cdi-pwms

Example:
sipl_devblk_pwm_4: sipl_pwm_gen_4 {
	compatible = "nvidia,cdi-pwm";
	pwms = <&tegra_pwm5 0 0>; /* by default the number of cells is 2 */
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	npwm = <4>; /* number of PWMs controlled by this chip */
	force_on; /* Force turn on PWM and disable control of sipl_devblk_pwm */
	status = "disabled";
};
