Tegra Virtual Watch Dog Timer

This implements the watchdog timer on Hypervisor based systems. The Virtual
WDT driver kicks the watchdog(once every 28 seconds by default) though ivc
communication to the WDT Server. When the Watch Dog Timer Server notices
that the watch dog kick is not received from the guest for a timeout
period(1 minute) the guest is rebooted

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra-hv-wdt"
- ivc: ivc channel used to communicate with the WDT Server to kick the watchdog

Example:
	tegra_hv_wdt {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra-hv-wdt";
		ivc = <&tegra_hv 77>;
	};
