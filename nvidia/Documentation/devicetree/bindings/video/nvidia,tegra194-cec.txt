NVIDIA Tegra Consumer Electronics Control

The Tegra CEC provides an engine for Consumer Electronics Control protocol
implementation. It is used to transfer command to connected monitor via
display connector.

This document describes the device tree bindings for the CEC hardware itself,
as well as for subnodes corresponding to this engine.

Required properties:
- status: Should be "disabled" in SoC and "okay" in Board DTSI.
- compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra194-cec".
- reg: A list of physical base address and length of the controller's
  registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt IRQ info for the controller.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  "cec"

Example:
=======

SoC DTSI:
--------

tegra_cec: tegra_cec {
	status = "disabled";
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-cec";
	reg = <0x0 0x03960000 0x0 0x00001000>;
	interrupts = <0 162 0x04>;
	clocks = <&bpmp_clks TEGRA194_CLK_CEC>;
	clock-names = "cec";
};

Board DTSI:
----------

tegra_cec: tegra_cec {
	status = "okay";
};
