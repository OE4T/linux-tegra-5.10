NVIDIA Tegra Display Port Aux.

The Tegra DPAUX provides an engine for programming Display Port Auxiliary
channels so that display data can be output to connected monitor.
It also used by HDMI for DDC communication with connected monitor.

This document describes the device tree bindings for the DPAUX hardware itself,
as well as for subnodes corresponding to this engine.

Required properties:
- status: Should be "disabled" in SoC and "okay" in Board DTSI.
- compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra194-dpaux".
- reg: A list of physical base address and length of DPAUX's registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt IRQ info for the DPAUX hardware.
- nvidia,dpaux-ctrlnum: DPAUX number mapping to display hardware physical number.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  "dpaux"
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  "dpaux"
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- power-domains: Power domain group, should be configured for controlling DPAUX hardware.
  This should always be set to "&disa_pd" because all of the DPAUX instances belong to
  the DISP domain.

Example:
=======

SoC DTSI:
--------

dpaux0: dpaux@155c0000 {
	status: "disabled";
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-dpaux";
	reg = <0x0 0x155c0000 0x0 0x00010000>;
	interrupts = <0 159 4>;
	nvidia,dpaux-ctrlnum = <0>;

	clocks = <&bpmp_clks TEGRA194_CLK_DPAUX>;
	clock-names = "dpaux";
	resets = <&bpmp_resets TEGRA194_RESET_DPAUX>;
	reset-names = "dpaux";
	power-domains = <&disa_pd>;
}; //dpaux0

Board DTSI:
----------

dpaux0: dpaux@155c0000 {
	status: "okay";
};
