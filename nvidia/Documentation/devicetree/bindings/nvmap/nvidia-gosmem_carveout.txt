NVIDIA gosmem carveout
-----------------------
"gosmem" carveout is reserved memory used for allocating "grid of
semaphore", GoS. GoS is used by CV clients, pva, dla, vi and isp
to allocate/modify bunch of semaphore values on one go.
This imrpoves perf.

This is child node of upstream /reserved-memory node.
It's used for OS to exclude the memory region for normal usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,gosmem";
- no-map: CPU can't map the memory for Rw
- cvdevs: CV(Compute Vision) clients who can access the gosmem carveout

Rest of the properties are common properties defined under /reserved-memory node Documentation

Example:
--------
	gos_reserved: grid-of-semaphores {
		compatible = "nvidia,gosmem";
		size = <0 0x6000>;
		alignment = <0 0x1000>;
		no-map;
		status = "disabled";
		cvdevs = <&nvdla0 &nvdla1 &pva0 &pva1 &vi_thi &isp_thi>;
	};
