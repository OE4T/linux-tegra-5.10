Tegra carveouts
---------------
Platform-defined memory regions of physically contiguous memory which are not managed by the OS.

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,carveouts" / "nvidia,carveouts-t18x" / "nvidia,carveouts-t19x";
- memory-region : Array of "reserved-memory" nodes. Each "reserved-memory" node represents exclusive
                  memory region not to be used by OS for normal usage. Refer /reserved-memory
                  documentation for further details.
- status = "okay / disabled";

Example:
--------
    tegra-carveouts {
        compatible = "nvidia,carveouts-t19x";
        memory-region = <&gos_reserved &generic_reserved>;
        status = "disabled";
    };

gos_reserved is the non Zero size reserved-memory region defined "reserved-memory" node.
Zero sized memory-regions should be kept at the end of memory-region array.
