NVIDIA ivm carveout
-----------------------

This is child node of upstream /reserved-memory node.
It's used for OS to exclude the memory region for normal usage.

The memory region,"ivm_carveout" declares ivm heap and used by nvmap
clients to allocate physical memory from the heap
with certain cache-attributes. The allocation from IVM heap is shared
in guest VMs.


Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,ivm_carveout";
- status: property is used to enable or disable the heap.
- reg: property is currently ignored, as IVM heap starting address and size are probed from hypervisor in run time.
- ivm: property links to the heap entry made in PCT platform_config.h,
       here the second element should be the index of the heap declared in in .mempools field
- alloc: property indicates whether it is a producer VM which can allocate or not.
         Note that for any IVM heap only one guest VM should configure alloc = 1, while other configures alloc=0

Rest of the properties are common properties defined under /reserved-memory node Documentation

Example:
--------
	ivm0: carveout0 {
		status = "okay";
		compatible = "nvidia,ivm_carveout";
		reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x04c00000>;
		ivm = <&tegra_hv 16>;
		alloc = <1>;
		no-map;
	};
