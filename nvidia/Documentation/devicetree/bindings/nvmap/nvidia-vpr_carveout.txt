NVIDIA vpr carveout
-----------------------
VPR is an acronym which stands for "Video Protection Region".
VPR is a region in memory which is secured by the MC from
access and modification by engines that are not part of the
video decode and display process.
The intended use of the VPR region is to prevent rogue
hardware or software from gaining access to protected video data

This is child node of upstream /reserved-memory node.
It's used for OS to exclude the memory region for normal usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,vpr_carveout";
- reusable: It tells the VPR memory can be used by CMA

Rest of the properties are common properties defined under /reserved-memory node Documentation

Example:
--------
	vpr: vpr-carveout {
		compatible = "nvidia,vpr-carveout";
		size = <0 0x2a000000>;
		alignment = <0 0x400000>;
		alloc-ranges = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x70000000>;
		reusable;
	};
