NVIDIA Tegra EMC BWMGR(External Memory Controller Bandwidth Manager)

Tegra EMC BWMGR controls the EMC clock rate by aggregating all the EMC client
requests and calculating the final clock rate.
EMC BWMGR also registers a cooling device with the thermal framework
(AO-therm zone) to track DRAM temperature which will impact efficiency tables.

Required properties:
	- compatible : "nvidia,bwmgr"
	- clocks : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs.
			This should be EMC clock for BWMGR.
	- status : Should be "disabled" or "okay"

Optional properties:
	- clock-names : List of clocks that control the memory subsystem
			managed by BWMGR. Input name strings sorted in the same
			order as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers
			will use clock-names to match clock input names
			with clocks specifiers.
	- cdev-type : Name of cooling device.
	- #cooling-cells : Provides cooling device specific information.
			Must be at least 2, to represent minimum followed
			by maximum cooling state.

	- cooling-min-level : The smallest cooling state.
	- cooling-max-level : The largest cooling state.

For more information on cooling device refer,
        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt

Example:
	bwmgr: bwmgr {
		compatible = "nvidia,bwmgr";
		clocks = <&bpmp_clks TEGRA194_CLK_EMC>;
		clock-names = "emc";
		cdev-type = "bwmgr-therm-handler";
		cooling-min-state = <0>;
		cooling-max-state = <1>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	AO-therm {
		status = "okay";

		thermal-zone-params {
			governor-name = "step_wise";
		};

		trips {
			trip_dram_refresh {
				temperature = <85000>;
				type = "active";
				hysteresis = <3000>;
				writable;
			};
		};
		cooling-maps {
			map0 {
				trip = <&{/thermal-zones/AO-therm/trips/trip_dram_refresh}>;
				cdev-type = "bwmgr-therm-handler";
				cooling-device = <&bwmgr THERMAL_NO_LIMIT THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>;
			};
		};
	};
