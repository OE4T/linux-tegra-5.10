NVIDIA Tegra APE aux CPU, with communication via the "IVC" IPC protocol.

APE is an aux CPU which talks to CCPLEX over IVC.

Its assumed that the APE FW implements IVC, and uses HSP IRQs as part of IVC.
Its also assumed that the APE FW expects AST regions 0/1/2 are already set up
for the APE to access FW in DRAM, SYSRAM if applicable, and the IVC memory.

== APE top-level node ==

The APE core is represented by the top-level node including direct HW resources
such as clocks, resets etc.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra186-ape-ivc" for T18x.
- reg: Address entries (APE BASE, APE IVC CPU AST, APE IVC DMA AST)
  Formatted as per standard rules for this property.
- reg-names: "ape-evp", "ast-cpu", "ast-dma" as per the reg property.
- clocks: Should contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Names of the clocks required by APE.
  Must include following entries:
  - ahub
  - apb2ape
  - ape
  - adsp
  - adspneon
- resets: Should contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Names of the resets required for APE.
  Must include following entries:
  - adspdbg
  - adspintf
  - adspneon
  - adspperiph
  - adspscu
  - adspwdt
  - ape
  - adsp
- nvidia,ivc-channels: IVC channel layout. See ./tegra-sce-ivc.txt.

Optional properties:
- nvidia,stream-id: should contain the SMMU Stream ID used.

== APE sub nodes ==

* hsp

Describes the hardware synchronization primitive(s) used.
See ./tegra-sce-ivc.txt for details (syntax is the same).

== Possible example ==
