NVIDIA Tegra SCE aux CPU, with communication via the "IVC" IPC protocol.

SCE is an aux CPU which talks to CCPLEX over IVC.

The SCE FW implements IVC, and uses HSP IRQs as part of IVC.  The
SCE FW expects AST regions 0/1/2 are already set up for the SCE to
access FW in DRAM, SYSRAM if applicable, and the IVC memory.

== SCE top-level node ==

The SCE core is represented by the top-level node including direct HW resources
such as clocks, resets etc.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra186-sce-ivc" for T18x.
- reg: Address entries (SCE EVP, SCE PM. SCE CFG BASE, SCE CPU AST,
  SCE DMA AST)
  Formatted as per standard rules for this property.
- reg-names: "sce-evp",  "sce-pm", "sce-cfg", "ast-cpu", "ast-dma"
  as per the reg property.
- clock-names: Names of the clocks required by SCE.
  Must include following entry:
  - sce-apb
- clocks: Should contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- reset-names: Names of the resets required for SCE.
  Must include following entries:
  - sce-apb
  - sce-nsysporeset
  - sce-nreset
  - sce-dbgresetn
  - sce-presetdbgn
  - sce-actmon
  - sce-pm
  - sce-dma
  - sce-hsp
  - tsctnsce
  - sce-tke
  - sce-gte
  - sce-cfg
- resets: Should contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- nvidia,ivc-channels: List of IVC channel regions.
  For each IVC channel regions (usually, there is only one region):
  - an OF phandle pointing to the list,
  - the region number for Tegra AST,
  - the base address of the region in the remote processor (for address space
    translation),
  - the length of the region in bytes (must be a power of two).
  For IVC channel details, please refer to: ./tegra-ivc-channel.txt

Optional properties:
- nvidia,stream-id: should contain the SMMU Stream ID used.

== SCE sub nodes ==

* hsp

Describes the hardware synchronization primitive(s) used between CCPLEX
and SCE to signal incoming IVC messages or IVC write room.

Required property:
- compatible: Should match with the device driver implementing the
    cross-processor synchronization primitive.

If the HSP doorbell is used for IVC notifications:

- compatible: "nvidia,tegra186-hsp-doorbell"

- nvidia,hsp-doorbell: <HSP-phandle HSP-ID HSP-DB>
  * HSP is a set of HW synchronization primitives used in Tegra to allow
    multiple processors to share resources and communicate together.
  * HSP-ID is NVIDIA Tegra HSP unique source ID for SCE, used in IPC.
  * HSP-DB is NVIDIA Tegra HSP unique doorbell number allotted to SCE.
    A HSP doorbell allows a set of source agents in Tegra to request the
    attention of specified target agent. In general the agents are processors
    and doorbell used as part of an IPC protocol.
  * For more HSP details, refer: ./tegra-hsp.txt.

If the HSP shared mailbox is used for IVC notifications:

- nvidia,hsp-shared-mailbox: <HSP-phandle MBOX-NUMBER HSP-phandle MBOX-NUMBER...>
  * HSP is a set of HW synchronization primitives used in Tegra to allow
    multiple processors to share resources and communicate together.
  * MBOX-NUMBER is number of shared mailbox pair
  * For more HSP details, refer: ../tegra-hsp.txt.

- nvidia,hsp-shared-mailbox-names:
  Must include following entry:
  - ivc-pair

If the HSP shared mailbox is used for boot synchronization:

- nvidia,hsp-shared-mailbox: <HSP-phandle MBOX-NUMBER...>
- nvidia,hsp-shared-mailbox-names:
  Must include following entry:
  - cmd-pair
