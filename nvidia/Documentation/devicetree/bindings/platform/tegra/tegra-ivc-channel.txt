NVIDIA Tegra IVC channel bindings

Each IVC channel represents the unique communication protocol defined
between kernel running on CCPLEX CPUs and remote CPU core. Each IVC
channel has two memory buffers, one for each direction. The RX buffer
is for messages sent by the remote CPU, the TX channel for
messages sent to the remote CPU.

Both IPC memory buffers are have two headers followed by data
frames. The first write header is updated only by the producer and the
second read header is updated only by the consumer. The header and
frame sizes are multiples of 64-byte cache lines.

== IVC channel top-level node ==

List of IVC channels implemented by remote core to talk to CCPLEX.
The top-level node defines a shared memory area allocated by IVC
channels within it.

== IVC channel sub nodes ==

Each IVC channel implemented by the remote CPU must be represented as
a separate child node within the top-level node.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should represent the protocol to be used on this IVC channel.
  See other binding documents in this directory for potential values.
  For example:
  "nvidia,tegra186-ivc-protocol-echo" for ivc echo test channel.
- nvidia,service: Protocol name.
- nvidia,version: Protocol version
- nvidia,group: Bitmap used fro shared semaphore signaling
- nvidia,frame-size: Size of the data frame. Must be a multiple of 64.
- nvidia,frame-count: Number of frames in rx or tx buffers.
  Must be a power of 2.

Example:

camera-ivc-channels {
	echo@0 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-ivc-protocol-echo";
		nvidia,service = "echo";
		nvidia,version = <0>;
		nvidia,group = <1>;
		nvidia,frame-count = <16>;
		nvidia,frame-size = <64>;
	};
}
