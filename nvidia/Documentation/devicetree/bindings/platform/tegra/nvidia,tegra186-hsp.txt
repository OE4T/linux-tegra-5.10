NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP)

The HSP modules are used for the processors to share resources and communicate
together. It provides a set of hardware synchronization primitives for
interprocessor communication. So the interprocessor communication (IPC)
protocols can use hardware synchronization primitives, when operating between
two processors not in an SMP relationship.

The HSP features supported are shared mailboxes and shared semaphores.
Arbitrated semaphores and doorbells are not currently used.

Required properties:
- name : Should be hsp
- compatible
    Array of strings.
    one of:
    - "nvidia,tegra186-hsp"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupt-names
    Array of strings.
    Contains a list of names for the interrupts described by the interrupt
    property. May contain the following entries, in any order:
    - "shared0" (for top0 or top1 hsp only)
    - "shared1", "shared2", "shared3", "shared4"
    - "shared5", "shared6", "shared7", "doorbell" (for top0 hsp only)
    - "full0" ... "full7" (for pre-routed full mailbox interrupts only)
    - "empty0" ... "empty7" (for pre-routed empty mailbox interrupts only)
    Users of this binding MUST look up entries in the interrupt property
    by name, using this interrupt-names property to do so.
    For "sharedX", X refers to the HSP_INT_IE_<X> register used to route HSP
    interrupts to a shared interrupt.
    For "fullN" and "emptyN", N refers to the number of the shared mailbox or
    register HSP_SHRD_MBOX_MBOX_<N>_SHRD_MBOX_0. Any "fullN" or "emptyN" can be
    used with APE HSP, which have all HSP interrupts directly routed to APE GIC.
    For other HSP blocks, the interrupt must be prerouted to a shared interrupt
    with a corresponding bit set in HSP_INT_IE_<i> register.
- interrupts
    Array of interrupt specifiers.
    Must contain one entry per entry in the interrupt-names property,
    in a matching order.
- #mbox-cells : Should be 2.
- nvidia,mbox-ie : if present, use mailbox-specific IE register

The mbox specifier of the "mboxes" property in the client node should
contain two data cells. The first one should be the HSP type and the
second one should be the ID of the mailbox that the client is going to
use. The information about data cell contents can be found in the
following file.

- <dt-bindings/mailbox/tegra186-hsp.h>.

Example:

hsp_rce: tegra-hsp@b950000 {
    compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-hsp";
    reg = <0x0 0x0b950000 0x0 0x00090000>;
    interrupts =    <0 TEGRA194_IRQ_RCE_HSP_SHARED_1 0x4>,
            <0 TEGRA194_IRQ_RCE_HSP_SHARED_2 0x4>,
            <0 TEGRA194_IRQ_RCE_HSP_SHARED_3 0x4>,
            <0 TEGRA194_IRQ_RCE_HSP_SHARED_4 0x4>;
    nvidia,mbox-ie;
    #mbox-cells = <2>;
    interrupt-names = "shared1", "shared2", "shared3", "shared4";
};

client {
    ...
    mboxes =
        <&hsp_rce TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM TEGRA_HSP_SM_RX(3)>,
        <&hsp_rce TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM TEGRA_HSP_SM_TX(0)>,
        <&hsp_rce TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM TEGRA_HSP_SM_RX(1)>,
        <&hsp_rce TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SS 0>;
    mbox-names = "progress-rx", "vm-tx", "vm-rx", "vm-ss";
};
