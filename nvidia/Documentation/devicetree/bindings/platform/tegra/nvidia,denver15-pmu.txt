NVIDIA Denver PMU
=================

This driver supports hardware perfmon event counting for the Denver L2 cluster.
The supported events are standard ARM L2 event numbering, but with a
0xd00 mask to differentiate these events from the A57 L2 cluster.

Required properties:
	- compatible: "nvidia,denver15-pmu"
	- interrupts: single hardware-specified interrupt
	- interrupt-affinity : this driver must be pinned to Denver core 0 (cpu@0)
		in order to correctly field PMU interrupts from the L2.

Example:
	denver-pmu {
		compatible = "nvidia,denver15-pmu";
		interrupts = <0 290 0x4>;
		interrupt-affinity = <&{/cpus/cpu@0}>;
	};
