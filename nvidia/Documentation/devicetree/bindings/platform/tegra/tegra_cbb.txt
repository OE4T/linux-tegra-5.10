NVIDIA Tegra19x CBB NOC driver
==================================

This document defines the device-specific binding for Tegra19x CBB NOC driver.

Control Backbone(CBB) comprises of the physical path from a master(or initiator)
to a slave’s(or target) register configuration space(Target’s Control Space).
CBB has multiple hierarchical sub-NOC's(Network-on-Chip) and stretches to
various master and slave partitions using different bridges like AXIP2P,AXI2APB.

This driver handles errors from master clusters with NOC(AON, SCE, RCE, BPMP,
CV) and CBB central NOC in case of failed transaction in a bridge within CBB.
Access issuing master is informed about error using Abort or interrupts.
For access from CCPLEX master, SError is delivered to all cores in CCPLEX.
For access by other masters, issuing master gets abort and CCPLEX receives
secure or nonsecure interrupt depending on error type.
 - secure_intr: SEC(firewall) & SLV errors.
 - nonsecure_intr: TMO & DEC errors.
By default, SError is masked for illegal accesses from CCPLEX master by setting
MISCREG_CCROC_ERR_CONFIG_0 to "1" & only interrupts are enabled.

The driver prints relevant debug information like Error Code, Error Description,
Master, Address, AXI ID, Cache, Protection, Security Group etc using NOC Error
Logger registers on receiving SError or interrupt. For APB slaves, it prints
additional information about exact error cause and AXI2APB bridge giving error.


Required properties for NOC's:
- compatible: Should be per NOC "nvidia,tegra194-CBB-NOC"
- reg: Physical base address and length of registers
- interrupts: irq numbers of secure and nonsecure interrupts for the NOC error

Example:
========
	cbb-noc@2300000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-CBB-NOC";
		reg = <0x0 0x02300000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 230 4>, <0 231 4>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	aon-noc@C600000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-AON-NOC";
		reg = <0x0 0xC600000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 260 4>, <0 172 4>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	bpmp-noc@D600000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-BPMP-NOC";
		reg = <0x0 0xD600000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 262 4>, <0 174 4>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	rce-noc@BE00000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-RCE-NOC";
		reg = <0x0 0xBE00000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 259 4>, <0 175 4>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	sce-noc@B600000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-SCE-NOC";
		reg = <0x0 0xB600000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 261 4>, <0 173 4>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	cv-noc@14040000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-CV-NOC";
		reg = <0x0 0 0x14040000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 238 4>, <0 239 4>;
		status = "okay";
	};

Required properties for AXI2APB bridge:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra194-AXI2APB-bridge"
- reg: Physical base address and length of registers for all bridges

Example:
========
	axi2apb@2390000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-AXI2APB-bridge";
		reg = <0x0 0x02390000 0x0 0x1000>,
		    <0x0 0x023A0000 0x0 0x1000>,
		    <0x0 0x023B0000 0x0 0x1000>,
		    <0x0 0x023C0000 0x0 0x1000>,
		    <0x0 0x023D0000 0x0 0x1000>,
		    <0x0 0x023E0000 0x0 0x1000>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
