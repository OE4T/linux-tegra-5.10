NVIDIA Tegra Xavier (T19x) NVCSI bindings

Tegra NVCSI is a MIPI CSI-2 receiver, supporting the D-Phy v1.2 and C-Phy v1.1
interfaces, it outputs packetized data directly to the VI5 unit. Functional
implementation of the APIs (incl. all calibration) is located in the Camera
RTCPU firmware.

The MIPICAL unit performs calibration at start of capture to condition the
impedance of CSI-2 D-Phy lanes. D-Phy initial DESKEW calibration is performed
when a sensor operates at or above 1.5 Gb/s. C-Phy edge delay trimmer
calibration is performed for sensors operating in that interface.

An internal Test Pattern Generator (TPG) module is present in this unit for
system bandwidth and image signal processing testing.

Pre-boot hardware auto-detection is peformed by the NVIDIA Tegra plugin-manager
for supported devices; if present, the attached camera board's Device Tree
configuration overlays additional fields for assembling a complete system
stream/channel graph for all camera sensor(s).

Required properties:
