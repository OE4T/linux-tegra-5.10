Combined uart is a tegra-specific mechanism used to multiplex a single physical
UART between multiple pieces of software. Instead of having Linux access the
UART registers directly, this mechanism involves Linux writing debug output to
an HSP mailbox register. Debug input is similarly received from a different HSP
mailbox register.

The debug data is received by a different processor, which then collects the
debug outputs from multiple processors and multiplexes them over the actual
physical UART. Input data is also received by the same processor, which
forwards it to the correct destination.

The combined uart device tree node contains the necessary data for the driver
to operate correctly.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra186-combined-uart".
- reg: Must contain the base address of mailbox registers.
-- Reg0: Must contain the RX mailbox base address
-- Reg1: Must contain the TX mailbox base address
-- Reg2: Must contain the HSP base address that has the RX interrupt control
	register.
- interrupts: Must contain the RX interrupt number

Optional properties:
- console-port: Should be present if the Tegra FIQ debugger needs to use this
	combined uart node for debug I/O.
- combined-uart: Should be present if the Tegra FIQ debugger needs to use this
	combined uart node for debug I/O.
