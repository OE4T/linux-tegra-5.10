NVIDIA Tegra AON SPI controller.

This is a wrapper driver that makes call to AON cluster which control
AON SPI controller. Clock, reset and dma controls are handled by native
driver in AON.

Required properties :
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra186-aon-spi".
- bus-number : SPI bus/controller number.
- mboxes : Mailbox used to communicate with AON SPI native driver.

Recommended properties:
- spi-max-frequency : Definition as per
                     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Optional properties :

spi-client device controller properties :
  Below properties should be defined under 'controller-data' child node.
  These values will be passed on to AON native driver.
- nvidia,cs-setup-clk-count : CS setup timing parameter.
- nvidia,cs-hold-clk-count : CS hold timing parameter.
- nvidia,cs-inactive-cycles : Cycles to be inactive between two packets.
  CS Inactive between packets is disabled if the value of this is zero.

Example:

aon_spi: aon_spi@c260000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-aon-spi";
	bus-number = <1>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <12000000>;
	mboxes = <&aon 2>;
};
