* Soltech JSA-1127 ambient light sensor

nvs_ drivers use the NVidia Sensor (NVS) framework.
See the nvs.txt documentation for NVS DT capabilities.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "solteamopto,jsa1127"
- reg: i2c address of the device. It can be 0x29, 0x39 or 0x44.

Optional properties:
- status: set to "ok" or "okay" for normal operation.  Set to anything else
	  to unload the driver without ever communicating with the device.
  Note: The "anything else" above is typically "disabled".
	Since the driver will unload without communicating with the device, the
	device will be left in its POR state.
- light_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the device and
		 unload the driver.
- vdd-supply: regulator supply for the chip
  Note: This is required if the driver is to control the regulator.
Format:	light_mode_settingname
Where:	'light' refers to the light sensor classification
	'mode' refers to data collection mode:
		hwm = hardware mode
		swm = software mode
		hyb = hybrid mode
	'settingname' is a named identifier and rather free-form, can include more underscores if desired

Valid Properties:
light_hwm_resolution_ival	:
light_hwm_resolution_fval	:
light_hwm_maxrange_ival		:
light_hwm_maxrange_fval		:
light_hwm_interval		: Time capture interval in ms.  5000 = 5 seconds.
light_hyb_resolution_ival	:
light_hyb_resolution_fval	:
light_hyb_maxrange_ival		:
light_hyb_maxrange_fval		:
light_hyb_interval		: Time capture interval in ms.  5000 = 5 seconds.

Future Properties (not yet implemented):
light_swm_resolution_ival	:
light_swm_resolution_fval	:
light_swm_maxrange_ival		:
light_swm_maxrange_fval		:
light_swm_interval		: Time capture interval in ms.  5000 = 5 seconds.


Example:
                jsa1127@39 {
                        compatible = "solteamopto,jsa1127";
                        reg = <0x39>;
                        light_hyb_resolution_ival = <20>;
                        light_hyb_resolution_fval = <0>;
                        light_hwm_maxrange_ival = <6553>;
                        light_hwm_maxrange_fval = <400000>;
                };
