* Capella CM3217 ambient light sensor

nvs_ drivers use the NVidia Sensor (NVS) framework.
See the nvs.txt documentation for NVS DT capabilities.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "capella,cm3217"
- reg: i2c address of the device. It should be 0x10.

Optional properties:
- illuminance,integration-time: minimum sampling period in nano seconds.
  default: ""480000""
- illuminance,max-range: maximum range of this sensor's value in SI units.
  default: "78643.2"
- illuminance,resolution: conversion factor from sensor raw units to lux.
  default: "307"
- illuminance,power-consumed: rough estimate of this sensor's power consumption in mA.
  default: "1670"
- status: set to "ok" or "okay" for normal operation.  Set to anything else
	  to unload the driver without ever communicating with the device.
  Note: The "anything else" above is typically "disabled".
	Since the driver will unload without communicating with the device, the
	device will be left in its POR state.
	This device's POR comes up in an operational mode and will draw power.
	If it is desired to unload the driver leaving the device in a low power
	sleep state, then use the individual sensor disable mechanism below.
- light_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the device and
                 unload the driver.
- vdd-supply: regulator supply for the chip
  Note: This is required if the driver is to control the regulator.

Example:
	cm3217@10 {
		compatible = "capella,cm3217";
		reg = <0x10>;
		vdd-supply = <&palmas_smps9>;
		illuminance,integration-time = "480000";
		illuminance,max-range = "78643.2";
		illuminance,resolution = "7675";
		illuminance,power-consumed = "1670"; /* milli Watt */
	};
