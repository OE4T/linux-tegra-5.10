NVIDIA Tegra timers

This device node specifies the properties of Nvidia designed timer hardware.

Unlike ARM architectured timers, these Tegra timers are not part of CPU,
instead, they are part of SoC.

Required Properties:
 - compatible: should be set to "nvidia,tegra186-timer"
 - interrupts: interrupt mapping for supported timers.
 - clock-frequency: timer frequency, an 32b integer.
 - reg: address range for configuration registers
 - tmr-count: the maximum number of supported timer units
 - wdt-count: the maximum number of supported watchdog timer units

Not all timers in the node need to be used.

Example:

	timer@3020000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-timer";
		interrupts = <0 0 4>,
			     <0 1 4>,
			     <0 2 4>,
			     <0 3 4>,
			     <0 4 4>,
			     <0 5 4>,
		clock-frequency = <19200000>;
		reg = <0x0 0x03010000 0x0 0x000e0000>;
		tmr-count = <10>;
		wdt-count = <3>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
