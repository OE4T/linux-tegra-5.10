* Device tree binding for Nvidia Tegra194 cpufreq driver
--------------------------------------------

This document defines the device-specific binding for the Tegra194 cpufreq
driver. It does not contain bindings for generic tegra cpufreq driver
which are common across all the tegra cpufreq platform driver.

The Tegra194 cpufreq driver makes frequency request by writing frequency hints
to per-core system register. It calculates per core cpufreq by reading per core
cycle counters. Cycles are measured by reading from system register twice, with
sufficient delay in between, then dividing the number of CPU clock cycles by
reference clock cycles, and scaling the result with reference clock frequency.

Behind the scene CPU interacts with AVFS and BPMP-FW to adjust CPU rail voltage
for the desired frequency.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra194-cpufreq".

- cpu_emc_map: an array of pairs of 32-bit unsigned integers.

               the first entry in each pair is the CPU frequency in khz
               the second entry in each pair is the EMC frequency in khz

               essentially, this is a table mapping the requested CPU
               frequency to the corresponding EMC frequency floor:

                     floor(requested_cpu_frequency) --> emc frequency

               the purpose is to maintain a good level of external memory
               bandwidth with the given CPU rate.

- status: "okay" or "disabled" to enable/disable the node.

Optional properties:
- cpufreq_single_policy
  If this property exists, all 8 CPUs in tegra194 share the same cpufreq policy
  If this property doesn't exist, one cpufreq policy is created for each cluster

- freq_table_step_size:
  A property of 16-bit unsigned integer.  Cpu frequency table step size.
  If not provided, frequency step is set to the 50MHz by default. The table step
  size is rounded to AVFS update frequency multiple when applied to CPU
  frequency table construction.

- nvidia,autocc3-freq: autocc3 cluster freq.
  This property is a list of 32-bit unsigned integers.
  If a cluster goes in idle, cc3 freq will be requested for that cluster.
  This property will be ignored if auto-cc3 is disabled in BPMP-FW.

  The 1st entry is the cc3 freq for the 1st cluster, the 2nd entry is the
  cc3 freq for the 2nd cluster, the 3rd entry is the cc3 freq for the 3rd
  cluster, the 4th entry is the cc3 freq for the 4th cluster.

  If auto-cc3 is enabled, but this property does not exist, or less than
  4 entries are in the list, the autocc3-freq will be calculated with
  parameters returned in BPMP-FW query response for the clusters without
  auto-cc3 frequency in the device tree.

Example 1: everything
----------
	cpufreq {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-cpufreq";
		status = "okay";
                cpu_freq_single_policy;
                freq_table_step_size = /bits/ 16 <0x6>;
                nvidia,autocc3-freq = <0 0 0 0>;
		cpu_emc_map = <2112000  2133000>,
				<1881600 800000>,
				<1574400 665000>,
				<1267200 408000>;
	};

Example 2: policy per cluster, default step size, no autocc3-freq
----------
	cpufreq {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-cpufreq";
		status = "okay";
		cpu_emc_map = <2112000  2133000>,
				<1881600 800000>,
				<1574400 665000>,
				<1267200 408000>;
	};
