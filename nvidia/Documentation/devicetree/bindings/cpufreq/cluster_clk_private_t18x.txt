cluster clock private device for t18x
-----------------------------
tegra18x cluster parameters can be overriden by cluster clock private registers.
These registers are not exposed to ARM_SW and can only be updated by MCE. For Hw
verification these registers are exposed to ARM_SW. For final release these
registers have to be made private and these bindings have to be removed
from ARM_SW.

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,t18x-cluster-clk-priv".
- reg: base address and size for below cluster clocks.
       sys_clock
       b_cluster_clk_priv
       b_cluster_clk_pub
       m_cluster_clk_priv
       m_cluster_clk_pub

- status: "okay" or "disabled" to enable/disable the node.

Optional properties:


Example:
--------
	cluster_clk_priv@0x0e0b0000  {
		compatible = "nvidia,t18x-cluster-clk-priv";
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
		reg = < 0x0 0x0e0a0000 0x0 0x64 >, /* B cluster clk priv base */
		      < 0x0 0x0e0b0000 0x0 0x64 >; /* m cluster clk priv base */
		status = "disabled";
	};
