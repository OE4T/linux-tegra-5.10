Nvidia, arm-smmu:
==================

The device node describes Nvidia iommu device node.
It contains common properties @/iommu/iommu.txt and
@iommu/arm-smmu.txt.
It also contains Nvidia specific properites to support
older kernel version iommu bindings.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible = Must be one of the following
               "t19x,arm,mmu-500"
- reg : Should contain 2 register ranges(address and length) pairs
  Register address space (MMIO).
- interrupts: Specify the interrupts IRQ info for device
- stream-match-mask : For SMMUs supporting stream matching and using
                      #iommu-cells = <1>, specifies a mask of bits to ignore
                      when matching stream IDs (e.g. this may be programmed
                      into the SMRn.MASK field of every stream match register
                      used). More can be find from upstream @
                      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm-smmu.txt.
- input-address-size: Number of address bits being physically connected to an
                      SMMU instance, as the input virtual address width. More can
                      be found @ upstream
                      @Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm-smmu.txt.
- iso-smmu-id : Number of iso smmus
- suspend-save-reg : Secure Scrach space to save SMMU configuration across suspend resume
- status : disabled or okay

Examples:
========

smmu: iommu@12000000{
		compatible = "t19x,arm,mmu-500";
		reg = <0 0x12000000 0 0x800000>,
		      <0 0x11000000 0 0x800000>,
		      <0 0x10000000 0 0x800000>;
		interrupts = <0 170 4>,
		stream-match-mask = <0x7F80>;
		input-address-size = <39>; /* Used by K4.14 only */
		iso-smmu-id = <2>;

		suspend-save-reg = <0x0c3902ac>; /* SCRATCH_SECURE_RSV73_SCRATCH_0 */

		status = "disabled";
}
