NVIDIA Tegra Boot and Power Management Processor (BPMP)

The BPMP is a specific processor in Tegra chip, which is designed for
booting process handling and offloading the power management, clock
management, and reset control tasks from the CPU. The binding document
defines the resources that would be used by the BPMP firmware driver,
which can create the interprocessor communication (IPC) between the CPU
and BPMP.

Required properties:
- name : Should be bpmp
- compatible:
    Array of strings
    One of:
    - "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp"
    - "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-hv"
    - "nvidia,tegra194-safe-bpmp-hv"
    Compatible string with "-hv" at the end means the the driver runs on a
    Virtualized System and the one without "-hv" means the driver runs on a
    Native system(without Hypervisor).
    The only difference between them is the communication channel.
    In native case,the sysram memory and doorbell are used for communication
    with bpmp firmware but in virtualization, ivc/mempool is used for
    communication with the Virtualized System that in turn interacts with the
    BPMP firmware
- dma-coherent: Must be present
- #power-domain-cells : Should be 1.
- #strap-cells: Should be 1
- #nvidia,controller-id-cells: Should be 1
- iommus: Phandle to the SMMU specifier
- reg: Three { base-address, size } pairs where first pair contains the
  bpmp register space, the second containing IPC TX shared memory and
  the third containing IPC RX shared memory.

Optional properties:
  The following properties are required only in the Virtualized driver
- ivc_queue: ivc channel used for communication with Virtualization System
- mempool: mempool used for data transfers with Virtualization System

Example:

	bpmp: bpmp {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp";
		iommus = <&smmu TEGRA_SID_BPMP>;
		dma-coherent;
		reg = <0x0 0x0d000000 0x0 0x00800000>,
			<0x0 0x4004e000 0x0 0x00001000>,
			<0x0 0x4004f000 0x0 0x00001000>;
		status = "disabled";
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		#strap-cells = <1>;
		#nvidia,controller-id-cells = <1>;

		bpmpthermal {
			...
		};
	};
