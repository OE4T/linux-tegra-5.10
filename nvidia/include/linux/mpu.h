*		A write to dbg_dat initiates an I2C write transaction

 * - delay_ms: The polling delay time between I2C transactions

 * Expected use of the nvi_mpu_ routines are as follows:

 * - nvi_input_mpu_port_alloc: Request a connection to the
 *      device. If successful, a port number will be returned to
 *      identify the connection.  The port number is then used
 *      for all further communication with the connection.
 * - nvi_input_mpu_port_free: Use to close the port connection.
 * - nvi_input_mpu_enable: Use to enable/disable a port.
 *      The enable and FIFO enable is disabled by default so
 *      this will be required after a port is assigned.
 * - nvi_input_mpu_delay_us: Use to set the sampling rate in
 *      microseconds.  The fastest rate of all the enabled MPU
 *      devices will be used that does not exceed the
 *      nvi_input_mpu_delay_ms setting of an enabled device.
 * - nvi_input_mpu_delay_ms: Use to change the port polling
 *      delay at runtime. There is only one HW delay so the
 *      delay used will be the longest delay of all the enabled
 *      ports. This is separate from the sampling rate
 *      (nvi_input_mpu_delay_us).  See function notes below.
 * - nvi_input_mpu_data_out: Use to change the data written at
 *      runtime for ports that are configured as I2C write
 *      transactions.
 * - nvi_input_mpu_bypass request/release: Use to
 *      connect/disconnect the MPU host from the device.  When
 *      bypass is enabled, the connection from the device to the
 *      MPU will then be connected to the host (that the MPU is
