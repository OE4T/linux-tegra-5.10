config PWM_FAN
	tristate "Tegra PWM Fan driver"
	depends on THERMAL
	help
	  Enables the fan driver that is controlled by pwm.

config THERMAL_GOV_PID
	bool "PID thermal governor"
	help
	  This governor manages thermals based on output values of
	  PID controller.

config THERMAL_GOV_CONTINUOUS
	bool "CONTINUOUS thermal governor"
	help
	  This governor will filter raw temperature with IIR filter ,fetch
	  active pwm table from cdev pwm table and then caculate target pwm
	  value. This will make fan run more quietly and smoothly.

config TEGRA_THERMAL_THROTTLE
       bool "Enable throttling of CPU speed on overtemp"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       depends on THERMAL
       help
         Passive cooling device that throttles clocks using cpufreq and pmqos
	 interfaces.

config TEGRA23X_OC_EVENT
	tristate "Tegra23x overcurrent event driver"
	depends on TEGRA_BPMP
	help
	  Tegra23x overcurrent event driver that shows the overcurrent enable
	  state and the event count via the hwmon subsystem.

	  Say 'Y' here if you want to learn the overcurrent enable state and
	  the event count from the user space.

config TEGRA19X_OC_EVENT
	tristate "Tegra19x overcurrent event driver"
	help
	  Tegra19x overcurrent event driver that shows the interrupt request
	  count, priority, CPU throttle control, and GPU throttle control via
	  the hwmon subsystem.

	  Say 'Y' here if you want to learn the overcurrent event from the user
	  space.

config USERSPACE_THERM_ALERT
	tristate "Userspace thermal alert cooling device"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	help
	  Adds cooling device for notifying user space to know whether
	  thermal alert occurred for temperature trip.

	  Say 'Y' here if you want to get notification of temperature alert
	  in user space.
