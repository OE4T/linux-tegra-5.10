/**
 * TVCF versions to be tested against.
 *
 * The semantics of the test versioning is such that:
 *   + Any version, V, where V is of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, will be
 *     matched against floor(V) where floor(V) is the greatest
 *     TVCF version that is less than OR equal to V.
 *
 *     For example, given some input version V and sensor dt test
 *     names support for versions 1.0.0, 2.0.0, and 2.5.0:
 *        -> floor(V = 1.0.0) = 1.0.0
 *        -> floor(V = 1.8.2) = 1.0.0
 *        -> floor(V = 2.0.5) = 2.0.0
 *        -> floor(V = 3.1.9) = 2.5.0
 *
 *     Given this, the sensor DT test can support any number of
 *     TVCF versions WITHOUT modifications granted there are no
 *     DT modifications between versions. Said another way, only
 *     versions incompatible with other versions need explicitly
 *     defined.
 *
 * To add support for a TVCF version that requires specific DT
 * checks:
 *     1) Add version to `enum sv_dt_link_version`
 *     2) Add version to `struct sv_dt_tvcf_version`
 *     3) Add version to `MAKE_LINK_ALL_FULL` macro
 *     4) Update properties accordingly

/**
 * Relations between a source property X, and a sink property Y.
 *
 * Only ONE relation may exist for each property pair for each
 * supported TVCF version. Any property can form any number of
 * unique property pair relations for each supported TVCF version.
 * Relations are uni-directional from X to Y in all cases.
 *
 * Unless explicitly stated any relation between X and Y is
 * LTYPE_FORBIDDEN. For example, if a LTYPE_REQUIRED relations exists
 * for X and Y for TVCF version 2.5.0 any other relation between
 * X and Y for TVCF != 2.5.0 is LTYPE_FORBIDDEN.
 *
 * LTYPE_FORBIDDEN:       The presence of X forbids the presence of Y.
 *                        The converse IS NOT true - if X is not present
 *                        Y can assume any state.
 * LTYPE_OPTIONAL:        The presence of X makes Y optional.
 * LTYPE_REQUIRED:        The presence of X requires the presence of Y.
 *                        This type has special meaning when X has a
 *                        LTYPE_ALTERNATIVE* relation to some property Z.
 *                        If X does not exist but Z does any LTYPE_REQUIRED
 *                        relations from X (i.e. to Y) become LTYPE_FORBIDDEN.
 *                        In other words, if an alternative to X is found,
 *                        X and all of its dependencies will be invalidated.
 * LTYPE_DEPRECATED:      The presence of X deprecates Y. This is not a failure
 *                        condition but a warning will be posted.
 * LTYPE_ALTERNATIVE:     Y is an alternative property to X. If X exists then
 *                        Y (and its dependents) are invalidated. If X does not
 *                        exist but Y does Y is validated in place of X. Then, X
 *                        and any of its dependents are invalidated.
 * LTYPE_ALT*_DEPRECATED: Same behavior as LTYPE_ALTERNATIVE except a warning
 *                        is posted. In other words, Y is an alternative to X
 *                        but Y is deprecated.
