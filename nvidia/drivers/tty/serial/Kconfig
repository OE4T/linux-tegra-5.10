config TEGRA_COMBINED_UART
	bool "Tegra combined UART"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_18x_SOC
	default n
	help
	  Tegra combined UART is a client-server model which allows a server
	  running on SPE to multiplex a single UART controller amongst multiple
	  UART clients.

	  This config enables the Linux client driver. Instead of
	  directly bit banging the UART controller, the client driver
	  communicates with the SPE server using mailbox registers. The SPE
	  server multiplexes the UART controller amongst the various clients.
	  This allows all the clients to send output and receive input through a
	  single UART controller.

	  Combined-uart uses 'ctrl /' as break-signal for SysRq, for example:
	  'ctrl / + h' for sysrq-help.

config TEGRA_COMBINED_UART_EARLY
	bool "Tegra combined UART early printk driver"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_18x_SOC || ARCH_TEGRA_186_SOC
	default n
	help
	  Tegra combined UART is a client-server model which allows a server
	  running on SPE to multiplex a single UART controller amongst multiple
	  UART clients.

	  This config enables the Linux client driver. With
	  this driver we are adding support for early printk
	  so that we can get early boot logs of kernel even before
	  initialization of serial driver itself.

config TEGRA_HV_COMM
	tristate "Tegra Hypervisor Communication"
	depends on TEGRA_HV_MANAGER
	help
	  Add support for emulating a TTY device over the Tegra Hypervisor interface.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called tegra_hv_comm.

config SERIAL_TEGRA_NOHW
	tristate "NVIDIA Tegra186 High Speed serial controller without HW flow ontrol"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA && TEGRA20_APB_DMA || TEGRA186_GPC_DMA
	default n
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  Similar driver as SERIAL_TEGRA, but without HW flow control support
