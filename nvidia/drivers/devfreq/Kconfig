config DEVFREQ_GOV_POD_SCALING
        tristate "Power On Demand Scaling"
        help
          Sets the frequency based on two properties:
          (1) The governor receives activity throughput hints that
          indicate whether scaling up or down is required
          (2) the load of the devices is estimated using busy times
          from device profile to determine if the frequency should
          be altered.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_POD_SCALING_V2
        tristate "Power On Demand Scaling v2"
        help
          Sets the frequency based on two properties:
          (1) The governor receives activity throughput hints that
          indicate whether scaling up or down is required
          (2) the load of the devices is estimated using busy times
          from device profile to determine if the frequency should
          be altered.
          Used with kernel-5.9 and later version

        default 100

config DEVFREQ_GOV_WMARK_SIMPLE
        tristate "Simple Watermark"
        help
          Sets the frequency based on monitor watermark events.
          This governor returns the next frequency from frequency table
          based on type watermark event.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_WMARK_ACTIVE
        tristate "Active Watermark"
        help
          Sets the frequency based on monitor watermark events.
          This governor calculates relation between current load and
          target load. The next frequency is calculated by multiplying
          this relation with the current frequency.

          The watermark values are updated so that the watermarks are
          triggered when the above algorithm would change the frequency.
