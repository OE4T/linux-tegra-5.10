        help
          If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
          I2C controller embedded in NVIDIA Tegra SOCs

        help
          If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
          I2C controller embedded in NVIDIA Tegra SOCs accessed via BPMP.
          This I2C driver is a 'virtual' I2C driver. The real driver is
          embedded in the BPMP firmware, and this driver merely communicates
          with that real driver.

	  This driver is a downstream version and there is a newer variant
	  available in modern kernels.

		Say yes to add Linux userspace sysfs nodes to read CPU/GPU/CV/SOC
		High Current Voltage regulators (VRS11) voltage, current and power.

config I2C_TEGRA_CAMRTC
        bool "Tegra I2C Camera RTCPU driver"
        depends on TEGRA_CAMERA_RTCPU
        help
          If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
          I2C controller embedded in NVIDIA Tegra SOCs accessed via Camera
          RTCPU processor. This I2C driver is a 'virtual' I2C driver
          compatible with I2C bus driver. The real driver is embedded in the
          Camera RTCPU firmware, and this driver merely communicates with
          that real driver.

config I2C_TEGRA_HV
        bool "Tegra I2C virtualization Support"
        depends on TEGRA_HV_MANAGER
        default y
        help
          Enables support for para-virtualized I2C client driver.
          Client driver is written to communicate with I2C server
          partition by using IVC (Inter VM Commuication) framework.
          IVC support is a prerequisite for this driver.

config I2C_TEGRA_SLAVE
	tristate "NVIDIA Tegra internal I2C slave controller"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	select I2C_SLAVE
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  I2C slave controller embedded in NVIDIA Tegra SOCs.

	  This driver supports byte mode where for byte read/write interrupt
	  is generated.

config I2C_TEGRA194_SLAVE
	tristate "NVIDIA Tegra194 internal I2C slave controller"
	select I2C_SLAVE
	help
	If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	I2C slave controller embedded in NVIDIA Tegra194 SOC.

	This driver supports FIFO mode for read/write transfers.
