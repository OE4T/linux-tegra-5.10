config EQOS
	tristate "NVIDIA Tegra Ethernet QOS driver"
	default n

	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about NVIDIA cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

config EQOS_DISABLE_EEE
	bool "Disable EEE support in MAC and disable EEE advertisement in PHY"
	depends on EQOS
	default n

	help
	  Say y in this config to disable EEE completely i.e, disable the
	  support for EEE in the MAC and disable the advertisement of EEE
	  support from the PHY as well.

config DISABLE_VLAN_FWD_TO_REAL_IF
	bool "Disable VLAN RX Packet forwarding to Real ethernet Interface"
	depends on EQOS
	default n

	help
	  This disables support to forward VLAN tagged packets to the
	  Real interface. If enabled, VLAN tagged packets are only forwarded
	  to the Virtual interface.

	  If unsure, say n.

config DISABLE_EQOS_CTRL_TRISTATE
	bool "tristate tx signal when cable removed "
	depends on EQOS
	default n

	help
	  This disables the logic to make sure that tx signal is tristated
	  when cable is not attached.

	  If unsure, say n.

config DEBUGFS_OBJ
	bool "Enable DEBUGFS_OBJ"
	depends on EQOS
	default n
