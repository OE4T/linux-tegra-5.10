 * Queue monitoring.
 *
 * The feature allows monitoring the DHD queue utilization to get the percentage of a time period
 * where the number of pending packets is above a configurable theshold.
 * Right now, this is used by a server application, interfacing a Miracast Video Encoder, and
 * doing IOVAR "qtime_percent" at regular interval. Based on IOVAR "qtime_percent" results,
 * the server indicates to the Video Encoder if its bitrate can be increased or must be decreased.
 * Currently, this works only with P2P interfaces and with PROP_TXSTATUS. There is no need to handle
 * concurrent access to the fieds because the existing concurrent accesses are protected
 * by the PROP_TXSTATUS's lock.
