description:
  The Lenovo ThinkEdge SE70 provides Digital Input/Output pins connected
  internally to a Nuvoton NCT5635Y GPIO expander. Some additional GPIOs are
  used to set the protocol for the transceiver IC connected to the serial
  ports (which can operate on RS-232, RS-485, RS-422 or LOOP mode).  This
  driver allows to control these GPIO pins by abstracting them through two
  GPIO controllers, one dedicated to the I/O pins and other dedicated to
  set the communication protocol for the serial ports. The serial port
  protocol is chosen according to the GPIOs (1,0), for ttyTHS0 port, and
  (3,2) for the ttyTHS1 port. They must be set according the supported
  protocols":" LOOP (0,0), RS-232 (0,1), RS-485 (1,0) or RS-422 (1,1).
