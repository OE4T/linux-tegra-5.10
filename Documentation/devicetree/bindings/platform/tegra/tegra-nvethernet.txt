=====================================================/

Required properties:
- compatible:			should be "nvidia,nveqos"
- reg: 				Physical base address and size of register
				space.
- interrupts: 			An array of tuples specifying IRQ number for
				each tx/rx queue in case of multi-queue, and
				for the only tx/rx queue,in case of single queue
				EQOS has a common interrupt for triggering any
				non DMA channel interrupts like link up/down.
				order of interrupts need to be listed as common,
				Tx followed by Rx interrupts.
- clocks: 			Holds Phandle and clock specifiers in same
				order for each entry in clock-names property.
- clock-names: 			Specifies the names of the needed clocks.
				pllrefe_vcoout: This is the parent PLL reference
				clock which is generated by the CAR module to
				EQOS IP.

				eqos_axi: This is the free-running AXI clock
				input provided by the application. The DMA and
				the MTL modules also operate with this clock

				eqos_rx: The external PHY provides this receive
				clock for RGMIII interfaces. This clock is
				125 MHz in 1 Gbps mode, 25 MHz in 100 Mbps mode,
				2.5 MHz in 10 Mbps mode. All RGMII receive
				signals received by the MAC are synchronous to
				this clock. This clock input is required for
				all PHY interfaces

				eqos_ptp_ref:The PTP reference clock. The HW
				signal name is clk_ptp_ref_i

				eqos_tx:The external or internal PLL provides
				this transmission clock. This is 125 MHz in
				1 Gbps mode, 25 MHz in 100 Mbps mode, 2.5 MHz
				in 10 Mbps mode. All transmission signals
				generated by the MAC are synchronous to this
				clock. This clock is required for all PHY
				interfaces

				axi_cbb: This is a free-running clock input
				provided by the application. The MAC Control
				Interface, CSR, and Station Management Agent
				(SMA) of the MAC run on this clock. The valid
				frequency range of this clock is 20–300 MHz
				(minimum frequency is 25 MHz when the MMC
				module is active in 1000 Mbps mode). Frequencies
				outside this range may result in incorrect
				operation.
- resets: 			Holds Phandle and rest specifiers in the same
				order for each entry in reset-names property.
- reset-names: 			Specifies the name of the reset line.
- iommus			A list of phandle and IOMMU specifier pairs that
				describe the IOMMU master interfaces of the
				device. IOMMU specifier points stream ID used
				for IP which can be used for address translation
- iommu-group-id:		These are unique id's that the IOMMU uses to
				put different devices into the same IOMMU group
				and shared address space
- dma-coherent:			Present if dma operations are coherent
- nvidia,ptp_ref_clock_speed: 	This is reference for PTP clock frequency and
				the value set for tegra is 312.5MHz.
				The frequency of this clock is programmable and
				can be configured based on the requirements.
				The maximum frequency it can take is 312.5MHz
				and minimum frequency is 25MHz
- nvidia,phy-reset-gpio:	The GPIO phandle and specifier for the PHY
				reset signal.
- nvidia,rxq_enable_ctrl:	Mode of the MTL Receive Queue to enable either
				AV mode or legacy mode.
				example: rxq_enable_ctrl = <rx0 rx1 rx2 rx3>
				0x0 = Not enabled, 0x1 = Enabled for AV
				0x2 = Enabled for Legacy, 0x3 = Reserved
- nvidia,pause_frames: 		Enable(0) Disable(1) for Pause frame support.
- nvidia,rx_riwt:		Specifies the RX wathcdog interrupt timeout in
				usec.The RIWT field is programmed as
				(<val> * 256) / 62.5. if rx_riwt is 0 then RIWT
				is disabled and IOC will be enabled. Minimum
				value is 3 and Maximum value is 1020.
- nvidia,num-dma-chans:		Number of DMA channels that need to be used.
				Minimum value is 1 and Maximum value is 4.
- nvidia,dma-chans:		The channel number of DMA channels to be used.
				Number of channels provided here should be equal
				to the value in nvidia,num-dma-chans property.
				Valid numbers are 0,1,2,3
- nvidia,num-mtl-queues:	Number of MTL Queues that need to be used.
				Minimum value is 1 and Maximum value is 4.
- nvidia,mtl-queues:		Queues that need to be filled based on the
				nvidia,mtl-queues. Valid numbers are 0,1,2,3
- nvidia,tx-queue-prio: 	Each byte in this property indicates the
				packet priorities 0 to 7. When this is set, it
				means the packet with that priority will be
				routed to the Tx queue specified in
				nvidia,mtl-queues property at the same index
				position.
- nvidia,slot_num_check:	List of flags (0x0 to disable, 0x1 to enable)
				to configure slot function per DMA channel.
				Once this flag is enabled the corresponding TX
				queue will be configured in AVB Strict priority
				mode, not in CBS mode. So it will starve
				TX queue 0 hence it is recommended to enable
				CBS to set bandwidth limits as per use case.
				The TX queue 0 can't be programmed for AVB mode,
				so the corresponding DMA channel can't be
				configured for slot function.
- nvidia,slot_intvl_vals:	List of slot intervals (with a range from 1usec
				to 4096usec) for fetching the data from
				system memory per DMA channel give in
				the dma-chans property. If this is not
				specified 125usec default will be used.
- nvidia,rx-queue-prio: 	Each byte in this property is a bit map of
				individual vlan priorities 0 to 7. When a bit is
				uniquely set in this property i.e. same bit map
				shall not be set in multiple bytes of this
				property, it means the tagged packet with that
				priority will be routed to the Rx queue
				specified in nvidia,mtl-queues property at the
				same index position.
- nvidia,dcs-enable:		Dynamic Channel Selection enable(1) or
				disable(0). This property is mutually
				exclusive with rx-queue-prio i.e. if this is
				enabled, then rx-queue-prio should not be
				provided and vice versa.
- nvidia,max-platform-mtu:	Maximum MTU size supported for a platform.
				currently it is set to 9000 for embedded
				platforms. if DT entry is not
				present then it will be set to 1500 for
				automotive platforms. In case of automotive
				platforms MAC is connected to a switch and not
				to PHY directly. The switch limits the max MTU
				to 1500B, hence this property is used to
				prevent configuring MTU size greater than 1500B
				for EQOS contoller as well. In case of
				embedded platforms MAC is connected directly to
				PHY and hence MTU size of upto 9018 is supported
				(9022 in case of tagged frame).
- phy-mode: 			Operation mode of the PHY interface and it
				should be "rgmii-id".
- phy-handle:			Phandle, specifies a reference to a node
				representing a PHY device;
MDIO node
- mdio:				Child of Ethernet controller which holds the PHY
				devices connected via MDIO bus
- compatible:			Should be "nvidia,eqos-mdio"
PHY nodes
- reg:				PHY ID number.
- marvell,copper-mode:		Mode of PHY is copper mode.
- marvell,reg-init:		Override some configuration registers based
				on this setting. Format is
				<reg-page reg mask value>,...;
eqos_cool_dev
- cooling-min-state:		An integer indicating the smallest cooling state
				accepted
- cooling-max-state:		An integer indicating the largest cooling state
				accepted
- #cooling-cells:		Used to provide cooling device specific
				information.Must be at least 2, one cell to
				specify minimum and maximum cooling state used
				in the reference. Please refer kernel-4.14/
				Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/
				thermal.txt for detail thermal related settings
